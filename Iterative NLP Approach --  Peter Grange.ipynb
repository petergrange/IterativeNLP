    "**Motivation:** I want to understand what aspects of customersâ€™ experiences inform how they rate business. By understanding what issues lead to both low and high ratings, this sort of analysis will equip businesses with information that can be used to both rectify problems and strengthen traits that are valuable to customers."

    "**Hypothesis:** I believe that I will be able to cluster business types with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, as well as see large trends between star levels. Although I believe some of the themes will be similar between high and low star ratings (people care about customer service, cleanliness, quality, etc. and they rate businesses high or low based on these criteria) and that keywords will be different (low reviews will include words like horrible, bad, awful, gross, mean, etc. while high reviews will have positive words), I am also interested to see if there are any unforeseen differences between star levels (i.e. does customer service being bad lead to low ratings, but does not show up as much in high ratings)."

    "#### Key Technical Insight:\n",
    "The key technical insight is to see that the iterative application of these techniques allow for progressively going deeper into the thematic strata of textual data. The first approach pass tf-idf and K-Means produces high level themes (in this case, business category and restaurant type) while subsequent pass of tf-idf and LDA hone in on lower level themes (in this case, key ideas or business features that lead to high or low reviews).\n",
    "\n",
    "This iterative approach, while applied here to business review data, could be used with all sorts of NLP data. Any situation where honing in on different strata within textual data is needed."

    "\n",
    "There is a plethora of business questions that business owners have. The problem is how to answer those questions with the available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some questions that every business has, particularly small, service-oriented businesses, like restaurants. What do my customers think about my business? My service? My quality? What do my customers care about? What gives them a positive or negative experience? What are they telling others about my business? How do I compare to my competitors? Etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a long time, these questions were hard to answer. You had to ask customers, create surveys, read isolated blogs, etc. But now with sites like Yelp, tons of relevant data is at business owners finger tips. Unfortunately, this data may not be organized to show what are common themes in customer reviews. The data does not initially allow you to compare your business to other similar business. In short, it takes work to turn the wealth of data into actionable information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I will seek to do just that, to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning (ML) to hone in on relevant business categories and pertinent topics to elucidate customers thoughts on specific business categories, to show what makes customers happy or unhappy enough to write reviews and share their thoughts."

With the exception of serial reviewers, reviews often come from very happy or more often very unhappy customers, which naturally skews the data. That said, it does show what people care enough about to bother reviewing for. So it tends to show the issues that customers get motivated over.\n",

Yelp describes the data set as \"includes information about local businesses in 10 cities across 4 countries.\" So while this is a good representation and enough to train a model off of, it is not a complete representation. Also, if we want insights, say, into the market in the USA or in rural areas, there will be skew based off of the data set."

    "Before I do any analysis, I need to convert the review data, which is stuctured as English sentances into a number vector that can be analyized by the computer. I will be doing a two step process in one step. \n",
    "1. The first step is to create a count vector, also called 'bag-of-words'. This count vector is simply a count of how many times a word from our dictionary (feature) shows up in particular sentance (row or sample). We could stop here with a count vector. This is enough to run a model on. But the issue with the count vector is that it will prioritize common words which may hinder our ability to generalize from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. So the second step, to avoid this issue, is to weight the the term frequency, represented in the count vector, by the inverse of the document frequency. Essentially, while term frequency assumes that more frequent terms are generally more telling for what a review is about, document frequency adds that if a term is in more documents, then it is probably less important for telling key information than a word that is in less documents.\n",

To do this, I will use the K-Means clustering algorithm. K-Means starts with random cluster centers and then assigns all of the samples to the cluster they are closest to. Then it re-adjusts the cluster center based off of the samples now assigned to the cluster. Then it re-assigns the samples to the new cluster center that it is now closest to. It continues to do this until there is no change between iterations in which samples are assigned to which cluster center."

The reviews mention words like \"recommend,\" they point out a few positive features like \"fresh ingredients,\" and they talk about specific features  or offerings like \"white pizza\" or talk about what \"style of pizza\" the business offers. While textual analysis offers less insights in this case, it does confirm that when you make people happy they will gush in glowing terms about your business and give you free advertising!"
